# ClockClock24 Python

Python port of the [ClockClock project](https://clockclock.com/).

> ClockClock 24 is both a kinetic sculpture and a functioning clock. Its hands veer from unpredictable, mechanical spinning, to perfect, synchronised alignment; to visually represent the abstract concept of time, and to report real time.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 or higher)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for the graphical interface
